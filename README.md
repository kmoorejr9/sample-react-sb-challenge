### Sample Spring Boot React Challenge
This repository's code and baseline are derived from [Baeldung's Tutorials Project](https://github.com/eugenp/tutorials). Each project is referred to by a particular article that elaborates on how to use a certain portion of Spring's framework. This particular project is drawn from the basic [CRUD Application With React and Spring Boot](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-react-crud).


### Intro & Expectations
The intention behind this project is to give a small playground for folks wanting to learn or needing to learn the basics of working with a full stack application. A set of sample "requirements" or "TODOs" has been added below. 


### Getting Started/Running the Application
This is the fun part. With Spring Boot, the easiest way to start the application is by running `./mvnw spring-boot:run`. This will start _both_ the front and backend of the application. If you'd like to start just the frontend - please see the [README](./frontend/README.md) for that module. 

### ToDo's

- [ ] Add a search or filter feature to the application which allows the vet staff to find a particular customer by email address
- [ ] Create a way for the vet staff to identify which invoices/bills have or haven't been paid in full yet
- [ ] Add some tests to the application to verify the above functionality works as _you_ intended it.
